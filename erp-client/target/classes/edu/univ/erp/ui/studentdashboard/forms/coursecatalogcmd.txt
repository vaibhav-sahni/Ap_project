Capacity progress bar or simple fraction (12 / 40).
Filters: semester, year, department (by courseCode prefix), instructor, weekday.
Sort: credits, availability, courseCode.
Actions: "View details" (opens detail panel). If the user is not registered yet and the section is open show a "Register" button.
In the All Courses list show a small badge: if capacity - enrolledCount <= 5 show "Few seats".
Use color: green for open, orange for few seats, red for full.

Behavior rules (important)

Disable Register if enrolledCount >= capacity or when user already enrolled (the back end must also validate).
Show a tooltip on Day/Time if text is long.
Perform registration/dropping asynchronously and refresh both lists and the calendar/timetable.
Recompute enrolledCount after register/drop and reflect changes in both lists.
